# HW 5

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a day-planner that highlighted the work hours of the day as past, present, or future based on the time using Moment.js. We were then to save the input into localStorage and keep the storage present on the page even through a refresh. 

I came close. I am still having issues saving the text input from an object into individual strings, and also recalling the text from localStorage back to the original input areas. I can't be far off, but I can't quite figure it out. 

The time portion of the exercise I do believe I figured out correctly, albeit by taking the long way around.
